Absoprtion tray column model - liquid contains H2O + MDEA, gas contains CH4 + H2S + CO2. Model is writtten generaly (N = number of trays). H2S is captured by MDEA and reaction is so fast that it reaches equilibrium (model does not decsribe it), but CO2 is kinetically driven - two describe options: 1) known kinetic konstant of reaction rate; or 2) known CO2 concentration via pH (see pdf file). Files with "OH" in name using pH, "regular" name using kinetic constant. Even models are written correctly, from mathematical point of view, results do not corespond with reality (ProMax software).
